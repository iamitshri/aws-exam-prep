# [aws certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) preparation tips

Collection of thoughts, strategies and prep material to pass the aws cert exams.

## Motivation

Play with your mind to create a trap for yourself to study for the exam.
- This works best for me: Pay for the Certification exam and schedule it. Now you will have to fight to get the worth of your the money and also avoid retake fee, or the chances are, your company pays for your cert only if you pass. 
- Have to win: You are the kind of person who never loses. So don't hurt your ego by failing. 
- Avoid embarrassment: Declare to your manager or co-workers that you are planning to take the exam. Save your face.
- If X can do it, I can too. 

Of course, The better attitude is to learn the material; success will follow automatically :)  

## Choosing the online course

Find what works for you and what has worked with most test takers. You may have access to multiple preparatory courses on platforms like udemy, pluralsight, lynda, acloudguru, linuxacademy etc. Stick to one source for the majority of your preparation. Once confident, fill in the gaps with other sources. After you carefully choose one source for your preparation, sticking to it for covering the exam syllabus reduces mental fatigue, saves time and reduces anxiety due to switching between platforms multiple times. 

## During Preparation
