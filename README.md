# aws-exam-prep

Collection of thoughts, strategies and prep material to pass the aws cert exams.

## Pay for the exam and schedule it.

Play with your mind to either save money by avoiding retake fee. Chances are, your company pays for your cert only if you pass, so fight to win. Declare to your manager or co-workers that you are planning to take the exam.  Hopefully, you create a trap for yourself to study for the exam and pass it. The better attitude is to learn the material; success will follow automatically :)  

## Choosing the online course

Find what works for you and what has worked with most test takers. You may have access to multiple preparatory courses on platforms like udemy, pluralsight, lynda, acloudguru, linuxacademy etc. Stick to one source for the majority of your preparation. Once confident, fill in the gaps with other sources. After you carefully choose one source for your preparation, sticking to it for covering the exam syllabus reduces mental fatigue, saves time and reduces anxiety due to switching between platforms multiple times.
